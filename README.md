## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS/SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- NPM Package dev dependency: sass, live-server, npm-run-all.

I used a simple NPM environment setup to run the SASS/SCSS bundler during development. After finishing the development process, I simply copied the entire project folder to the same directory, renamed it, and deleted the 'node_modules' folder. Then, I manually uploaded the complete project folder (without 'node_modules') to Netlify.
